Explanation:

    The function missingNumber takes a list of integers nums as input and returns the missing number in the range [0, n].

    The expected sum of numbers from 0 to n can be calculated using the formula (\frac{{n \times (n + 1)}}{2}), where (n) is the length of the array nums.

    The sum function is used to calculate the actual sum of numbers in the given array nums.

    The difference between the expected sum and the actual sum gives us the missing number in the array.

    The missing number is returned as the output of the function.

Overall, the solution efficiently calculates the missing number in the given array by comparing the expected sum with the actual sum of numbers.
